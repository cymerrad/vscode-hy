# Hylang support for VSCode
Based on `sjhuangx/vscode-scheme` and `xuqinghan/vscode-hy`, but is much more than just a REGEX replace of `scheme -> hy`.
Also a bit modernized and fixed where possible (WIP).

# Done
- using .jsons instead of .xml
- fixed single-quote pairing
- removed scheme-only keywords

# TODO
- illegal parenthesis
- lists and dictionaries
- octals and hexes
